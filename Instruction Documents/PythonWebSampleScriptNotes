Attached is a general scaffolding of the Python Web Service for the score board with all 4 methods.

It includes the Timer function which is a global variable

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Per our conversation, I think this would be the approach I would take:

1. Create 4 web services on the PI
  GetTime() – retrieves the current timer
  GetStatus() – retrieves whether the timer is running or stopped
  SetStartTimer() – starts the timer and continually writes to MySQL using a database connection pool (if GetStatus() returns “stopped”)
  SetStopTimer() – stops the timer and update the database? (if GetStatus() returns “running”)
  
2. Create a web page in PHP which:
  Has a button which calls SetStartTimer()
  Has a button which calls SetStopTimer()
  Has a built in timer to poll ever second the GetTime() web method which shows the time on the browser
